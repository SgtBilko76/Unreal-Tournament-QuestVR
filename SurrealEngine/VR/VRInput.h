// Head/body/aim decoupling for the OpenXR VR port - see the plan this was built against
// (head tracking drives the camera only; a body-facing yaw independent of head yaw drives
// movement; the right motion controller drives weapon aim independently of both), modeled on
// Team Beef Studios' QuakeQuest's hmdorientation/playerYaw/gunangles split
// (QuakeQuest-master/Projects/Android/jni/QuakeQuestSrc/QuakeQuest_OpenXR.c).
//
// Owned by Engine (see Engine.h's `window` member for the analogous existing pattern) and
// updated once per frame from Engine::Run()'s VR branch, which is the only caller.
